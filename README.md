A revamp of one of my first "real" projects. which also happened to be a take-home code assessment for my first internship.

If you would like to see a before and after check out the old one over here:
https://github.com/heyoitsJuice/weather-app

It's not deployed, so you'll need to run it yourself if you do choose to check it out.

*** 

This newly revamped version utilizes NextJS, ChakraUI, and React on the front-end.
Axios is used for making requests/calls to the OpenWeatherMap API.
MomentJS is used for reading unix values and formatting time/date values.
Vercel was used for deployment due to seamless integration with NextJS.
